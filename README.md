# HEP Analysis Tools
The analysis scripts and functions of high energy physics.


## Abstract
This repository is my HEP analysis framework.


## 1. `svj_analysis`
* My SVJ analysis framework.
* First layer stores analysis python scripts and shell scripts (demo).
* `myhep` stores all analysis functions.

1. For analysis python scripts,
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>analysis-1.py</th>
        <td>description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>analysis-2.py</th>
        <td>description</td>
    </tr>
</table>

2. For shell scripts,


3. For `myhep`,
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>analysis_v3</th>
        <td>description</td>
    </tr>
</table>

* `scheme`: Different analysis, such as faster, more powerful, more general.
* `v`: Version, `scheme1_v1` and `scheme1_v2` are the same function, but the algorithms are different.
